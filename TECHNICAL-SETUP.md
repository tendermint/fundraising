# Technical Setup

To ensure you have a successful experience working with our fundraising module, we recommend this technical setup.

## Github Integration

Click the GitHub icon in the sidebar for GitHub integration and follow the prompts.

Clone the repos you work in

- Fork or clone the https://github.com/tendermint/fundraising repository.

Internal Tendermint users have different permissions, if you're not sure, fork the repo.

## Software Requirement

To build the project:

- [Golang](https://golang.org/dl/) v1.21 or higher
- [make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/) to use `Makefile` targets

## Development Environment Setup

Setup git hooks for conventional commit. 

1. Install [`pre-commit`](https://pre-commit.com/)

2. Run the following command:
    ```bash
    pre-commit install --hook-type commit-msg
    ```

3. (Optional for macOS users) Install GNU `grep`:

4. Run the following command
    ```bash
    brew install grep
    ```

5. Add the line to your shell profile:
    ```bash
    export PATH="/usr/local/opt/grep/libexec/gnubin:$PATH"
    ```

Now, whenever you make a commit, the `pre-commit` hook will be run to check if the commit message conforms [Conventional Commit](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) rule.

## Building

To build the fundraising module node and command line client, run the `make build` command from the project's root folder. The output of the build will be generated in the `build` folder.

For cross-builds use the standard `GOOS` and `GOARCH` env vars. i.e. to build for windows:

```bash
GOOS=windows GOARCH=amd64 make build
```

## Installation

To install the node client on your machine, run `make install` command from the project's root directory. 

> ðŸ’¡ you can also use the default `go` command to build the project, check the content of the [Makefile](https://github.com/tendermint/fundraising/blob/main/Makefile#L77) for reference

## Testing

Run `make test-all` command to run tests.

> ðŸ’¡ you can also use the default `go` command to build the project, check the content of the [Makefile](https://github.com/tendermint/fundraising/blob/main/Makefile#L128) for reference

## Localnet

To start a local blockchain, you can simply run the following command. The command uses Ignite CLI to start a local blockchain node with automatic reloading. If you don't have Starport set up in your local machine, see this [install guide](https://docs.ignite.com/#install-starport) to install it.  

```bash
make localnet
```

## Swagger

A [Swagger](https://swagger.io/) specification file is exposed under the `/` route on the API server (port using 1317). Swagger is an open specification describing the API endpoints a server serves, including description, input arguments, return types and much more about each endpoint. 

Enabling the `/` endpoint is configurable inside `~/.fundraisingd/config/app.toml` through the `api.swagger` field, which is set to `true` by default.
